# Amazon Fake Review Identification & Application in Recommender System

Amazon, the largest eCommerce platform, is highly popular and valued by customers not only for the variety of its products & services but also for its recommendations made. Amazon uses item-based collaborative filtering to generate quality product recommendations for its customers in the back-end currently, which is quite effective and scalable in general based on customers' purchase histories. However, in reality, not all Amazon product reviews made by customers, through which quality products stand out among the mediocre ones, are authentic / "real". "Fake" reviews appear from time to time as promotion-intended or biased. These fake reviews not only give customers an unrealistic view of a product and negatively impact customers' judgment, but also impede Amazon's ability to recommend relevant products & services to its customers.

Therefore, based on this observation from real life, we are interested in helping Amazon better identify fake reviews and take actions against them ("curb" the fake reviews). And further, we want to build a better recommendation system for Amazon, given the recommendations would be based on an accurate representation of customer opinions without distortion from the fake ones, so that Amazon's customers can benefit more from the recommendation mechanism.

The project consists of two stages of tasks: first it focuses on detecting fake reviews using the Amazon Deception review dataset (https://github.com/aayush210789/Deception-Detection-on-Amazon-reviews-dataset; data with label to signal "fake" or not, and balanced data with 50%:50% fake:real) as the training data, and the model is applied to the Amazon Luxury Beauty Reviews dataset (section "Luxury Beauty" extracted from the larger Amazon Reviews Dataset: http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html) to predict which of the reviews are fake; then, after prediction of the fake reviews from the real ones is obtained, those real reviews are used as the data to create an improved Amazon recommender system. In the first stage, NLP, feature extraction and feature engineering techniques are employed unto the reviews textual data to preprocess and capture the most informative features (those common between the training and testing data), and several machine learning algorithms - such as logistic regression, decision tree, and gradient boosting - are applied for the predictive modeling; in the second stage, a variety of recommender system approaches, including both neighborhood-based and latent factor types of collaborative filtering (e.g. item kNN & user kNN, CoClustering, Slope One, Factor Wise Matrix Factorization, SVD), have been experiemented to compare the recommenderation performance based on statistical accuracy evaluation metrics (e.g. RMSE, MAE, NMAE). We also demonstrated that our recommender system built only on the genuine reviews data would indeed make very different recommendations from the recommender system built on the original unfiltered reviews data, so the idea basically turns out to work.

The intended use case for the project's fake review predictive model and the corresponding recommender system is to be embedded on Amazon's current platform where it shows the customer other products relevant to the ones the customer has bought, so that Amazon can have a better chance of getting rid of the potentially fake reviews and provide a more transparent "review reliability score" for customers when they see a review, as well as enhancing recommendations.
